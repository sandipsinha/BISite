BISite Python Backend with Flask
This is a Python based app which will ask the user for inputs which would change the settings. This setting file will then be 
used for scheduling a job which will fire off the Data extraction, Transform(T) and final Load(L) process. The backend is mysql 
and the template used is Jinja2.
